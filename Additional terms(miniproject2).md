# Additional Terms
Below are definition of some terms used in programming and Python

## 1. **Indentation**
  A block is a combination of all these statements. Block can be regarded as the grouping of statements for a specific purpose. Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. One of the distinctive features of Python is its use of indentation to highlight the blocks of code. Whitespace is used for indentation in Python. All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right.

## 2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
  The term "don't repeat yourself" was coined in 1999 by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer. They defined it as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."
In software engineering, DRY is the principle of reducing repetition in the code.

## 3. **Design Patterns from Gang of Four**
  Design patterns provide solutions to common software design problems. In the case of object-oriented programming, design patterns are generally aimed at solving the problems of object generation and interaction, rather than the larger scale problems of overall software architecture. They give generalised solutions in the form of templates that may be applied to real-world problems. Design patterns are a powerful tool for software developers. However, they should not be seen as prescriptive specifications for software. It is more important to understand the concepts that design patterns describe, rather than memorising their exact classes, methods and properties. It is also important to apply patterns appropriately. Using the incorrect pattern for a situation or applying a design pattern to a trivial solution can overcomplicate your code and lead to maintainability issues.

## 4. **Class**
  A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.

Instance attributes are owned by the specific instances of a class. This means for two different instances the instance attributes are usually different. We can also define attributes at the class level. Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside of all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.

## 5. **Object**
  An object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

  In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
  
## 6. **Static**
 A static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program. This is in contrast to shorter-lived automatic variables, whose storage is stack allocated and deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects, whose storage is dynamically allocated and deallocated in heap memory.
 
## 7. **Property/ Attribute -**
In python, everything is an object. And every object has attributes and methods or functions. Attributes are described by data variables for example like name, age, height etc.
Properties are special kind of attributes which have getter, setter and delete methods like __get__, __set__ and __delete__ methods.

## 8. **Method -**
A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.

The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.
The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class

## 9. **Exception**
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal. Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it.

## 10. **Unit Test -**
The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

## 11. **Constructor**
Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created.In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.

**default constructor :** The default constructor is simple constructor which doesn’t accept any arguments.It’s definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.

**parameterized constructor :** constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor.The parameterized constructor take its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.

## 12. **Factory -**
Factory Method is a creational design pattern used to create concrete implementations of a common interface.
It separates the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the interface of the object.
For example, an application requires an object with a specific interface to perform its tasks. The concrete implementation of the interface is identified by some parameter.

## 13. **Decorator -**
A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.

## 14. **Extend Class -**
Parent classes are normally supersets of something. For example, you might create a parent class named Car and then create child classes of various car types around it.

In this case, you build a parent class named Animal and use it to define a child class named Chicken. Of course, you can easily add other child classes after you have Animal in place, such as a Gorilla class. However, for this example, you build just the one parent and one child class.

## 15. **CSV Files -**
CSV is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database.
 
## 16. **Reading Files -**

Rather than deal with a list of individual String elements, you can read CSV data directly into a dictionary.
