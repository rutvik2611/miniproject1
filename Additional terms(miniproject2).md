#Additional Terms
Below are definition of some terms used in programming and Python


## 1. **How Python uses Indentation to control Flow -**
## 2. **Don't Repeat Yourself -**
## 3. **Design Patterns from Gang of Four -**
## 4. **Class -**
  A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.

  Instance attributes are owned by the specific instances of a class. This means for two different instances the instance attributes are usually different. We can also define attributes at the class level. Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside of all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.

## 5. **Object -**
  An object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

  In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
## 6. **Static -**
  A static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program. This is in contrast to shorter-lived automatic variables, whose storage is stack allocated and deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects, whose storage is dynamically allocated and deallocated in heap memory.
## 7. **Property/ Attribute -**
## 8. **Method -**
## 9. **Exception -**
## 10. **Unit Test -**
## 11. **Constructor -**
## 12. **Factory -**
## 13. **Decorator -**
## 14. **Extend Class -**
## 15. **CSV Files -**
## 16. **Reading Files -**
