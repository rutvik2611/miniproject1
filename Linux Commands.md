# Linux Commands



## History of Linux
Unix developed out of the Multics project iteration at the Bell Laboratories’ Computer Sciences Research Center. The developers working on Multics at Bell Labs and elsewhere were interested in building a multi-user operating system with single-level storage, dynamic linking (in which a running process can request that another segment be added to its address space, enabling it to execute that segment’s code), and a hierarchical file system.

Bell Labs stopped funding the Multics project in 1969, but a group of researchers, including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, continued working with the project’s core principles. In 1972-3 they made the decision to rewrite the system in C, which made Unix uniquely portable: unlike other contemporary operating systems, it could both move from and outlive its hardware.

Research and development at Bell Labs (later AT&T) continued, with Unix System Laboratories developing versions of Unix, in partnership with Sun Microsystems, that would be widely adopted by commercial Unix vendors. Meanwhile, research continued in academic circles, most notably the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California Berkeley. This group produced the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), which inspired a range of operating systems, many of which are still in use today. Two BSD distributions of historical note are NeXTStep, the operating system pioneered by NeXT, which became the basis for macOS, among other products, and MINIX, an educational operating system that formed a comparative basis for Linus Torvalds as he developed Linux.


## Basic Linux Commands

**cd -**
This is a Unix command that is used to change directory

**mkdir -**
This is a Unix command that is used to create or make directory

**cp -**
This is a Unix command that is used to copy computer files and directories

![Screenshot of cp command](/Dependency/cp.png)

**pwd -**
This is a Unix command that is used to print working directory

![Screenshot of pwd command](/Dependency/pwd.png)

**mv -**
This is a Unix command that moves or rename one or more files or directories. The first screenshot shows a file being moved to a new directory. The second shows a file being rename. These are the primary functions of mv

**rm -**
This a Unix command that removes objects or computer files from a folder or path. This screenshot shows an example of rm being used

**Home directory -**
A home directory, also called a login directory, is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories and programs. It is also the directory that a user is first in after logging into the system

**File paths in linux -**
A file path is the human-readable representation of a file or folder’s location on a computer system. This screenshot shows the file path for this Linux Command file within my computer.

**Using the tab key to complete file paths -**
The tab key allows you to complete a file path without having to type it all out.It only works if you are in a directory that has the directory or path you plan to change to. For example, if you are in /Desktop and want to change to /NJIT, you can simply ty NJ and hit tab to complete the directory name /NJIT.

**Using up and down arrow for history -**
The up and down arrow keys allows you retrieve and use commands that you have used in the same Terminal window. Instead of typing a command again, you can simply use either the up or down key to retrieve this command.
