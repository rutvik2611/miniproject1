**File paths in linux**



**Using the tab key to complete file paths**
The tab key allows you to complete a file path without having to type it all out.It only works if you are in a directory that has the directory or path you plan to change to. For example, if you are in /Desktop and want to change to /NJIT, you can simply ty NJ and hit tab to complete the directory name /NJIT.


**Using up and down arrow for history**
 The up and down arrow keys allows you retrieve and use commands that you have used in the same Terminal window. Instead of typing a command again, you can simply use either the up or down key to retrieve this command.
